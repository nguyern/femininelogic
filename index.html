      <span class="author">Judy Attfield / JSTOR</span>
      <div class="desc">
        This essay connects design history to gender, exploring how women’s work has often been undervalued or overlooked.

The text challenges traditional ideas of what counts as design, making it foundational for feminist design studies.
